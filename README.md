# React Account Manager

This project is a simple React application that allows users to create and manage accounts. It includes a login page, a registration page, and a page where users can view and edit their account information.

# Features

- User Registration
- User Login
- Account Management (View and Edit user information)
- Basic form validation
- Protected routes for authenticated users

# Technologies Used

- React 16
- React Router for navigation
- Bootstrap for styling
- Local Storage for data persistence (Note: This is for demonstration purposes only and not suitable for production use)

# Getting Started

1.Clone the repository
2.Install dependencies: npm install
3.Start the development server: npm start
4.Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

# Project Structure

- src/App.js: Main component with routing logic
- src/components/Login.js: Login page component
- src/components/Register.js: Registration page component
- src/components/AccountManagement.js: Account management page component
- src/components/PrivateRoute.js: Higher-order component for protected routes

# Notes

- This project uses Local Storage for data persistence, which is not secure for storing sensitive information. In a real-world application, you would use a backend server with proper authentication and database storage.

- The project focuses on demonstrating React concepts and does not include comprehensive security measures. Additional security considerations would be necessary for a production application.

# Future Improvements

- Implement proper backend integration with secure authentication.
- Add more robust form validation and error handling.
- Enhance the user interface and add more account management features.
- Implement state management solution (e.g., Redux or Context API) for better data flow.
